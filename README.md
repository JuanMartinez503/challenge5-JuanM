# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler by Juan Martinez

## My Task

My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code provided HTML/CSS and I provided the jquery necessary to make the application work as expected. the owner of the starter code is Georgeyoo on github.com. 
### Here are some screenshots of the deployed application.
